# Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

Welcome to my **Data Warehouse & Analytics Project**
This project is part of my journey toward becoming a **Data Engineer**, and it showcases the core skills and tools used in modern data engineering — from building a data warehouse to creating analytical datasets and running insights.

## 🧱 Data Architecture (Medallion Framework)

I structured this project using the **Bronze → Silver → Gold** medallion architecture, which is widely used in the industry:

1. **Bronze Layer** – Raw data exactly as received (CSV files loaded into SQL Server).
2. **Silver Layer** – Cleaned, standardized, and well-formatted datasets.
3. **Gold Layer** – Business-ready analytical tables modeled using star schema.

This layered approach helps maintain data quality, traceability, and flexibility.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project covers the full lifecycle of data engineering:

### 🔹 1. Data Architecture

Designing a scalable data warehouse using modern engineering standards.

### 🔹 2. ETL/ELT Pipelines

Building extraction, transformation, and loading processes using SQL.

### 🔹 3. Data Modeling

Creating dimension and fact tables optimized for analytics.

### 🔹 4. Reporting & Insight Generation

Writing SQL queries to uncover business insights such as:

* Customer trends
* Product performance
* Sales patterns over time

This project helps me develop strong skills in:

* Data Engineering
* SQL Development
* ETL Pipeline Design
* Data Modeling
* Analytics & Reporting
* Documentation & Version Control

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources I Used

Everything I used for this project is free and beginner‑friendly:

* **SQL Server Express** – For hosting the data warehouse.
* **ADS (Azure Data Studio)** – For database management.
* **CSV Datasets** – Provided sample ERP & CRM data.
* **DrawIO** – For data architecture & modeling diagrams.
* **Git & GitHub** – For version control.
* **Notion** – Planning and tracking project phases.

## 🎯 Project Goal (Data Engineering Focus)

The main goal was to build a functioning, well‑structured data warehouse capable of supporting analytical queries.

### Requirements I worked on:

* Importing data from two systems (ERP + CRM)
* Cleaning and standardizing messy data
* Joining and integrating the sources
* Building a clear star schema
* Documenting my model & architecture for analytics teams
* Generating SQL‑based insights

This is a foundational project for real-world data engineering work.
